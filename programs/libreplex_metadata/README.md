### SPL-TOKEN 2022 METADATA ###

LibrePlex development is currently focused primarily on Fair Launch, DeFi integration and Inscriptions.

In terms of the metadata standard, LibrePlex will be adopting Solana TOKEN-2022 standard, the basic
structure is defined here:

https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/token-metadata/interface/src/state.rs

The basic metadata struct is quite rudimentary and does not currently allow for advanced metadata concepts
such as royalties / attributes etc. We will be providing LibrePlex extensions to Token-2022 as 
needed. However the immediate term goal is to support the adoption of Token-2022 metadata standard, starting
with Fair Launch and Inscriptions.
